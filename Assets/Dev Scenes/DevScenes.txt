Let's put dev/demo scenes here as this will make sense when docs are written for setup instructions for either the vehicle controller only usage and if then desired, the vehicle entry additions to such....

ie:

AllVehiclesDevScene-wEntry.unity   (to test/dev & continue on with all vehicles in one scene with entry)
ArmoredTruckDevScene.unity         (to test/dev & continue on with ArmoredTruck only in scene)
ArmoredTruckDevScene-wEntry.unity  (to test/dev & continue on with ArmoredTruck only in scene with entry)
DuneBuggyDevScene.unity            (to test/dev & continue on with DuneBuggy only in scene)
DuneBuggyDevScene-wEntry.unity     (to test/dev & continue on with DuneBuggy only in scene with entry)
HumveeDevScene.unity               (to test/dev & continue on with Humvee only in scene)
HumveeDevScene-wEntry.unity        (to test/dev & continue on with Humvee only in scene with entry)
SedanDevScene.unity                (to test/dev & continue on with Sedan only in scene)
SedanDevScene-wEntry.unity         (to test/dev & continue on with Sedan only in scene with entry)
SixWheelTruckDevScene.unity        (to test/dev & continue on with SixWheelTruck only in scene)

TankUSDevScene.unity               (to test/dev & continue on with TankUS only in scene)
TankUSDevScene-wEntry.unity        (to test/dev & continue on with TankUS only in scene with entry)
